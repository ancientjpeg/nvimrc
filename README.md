# Jackson's `nvim` Configuration

Just my personal setup for neovim. I've tried to comment pretty extensively (mostly for my own benefit), so there should be some useful tidbits in here for anyone creating their own neovim environment. It's a combination of many things, mostly guided by [ThePrimeagen's](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) incredibly useful tutorials, as well as the amazingly helpful r/neovim community.

If anyone finds a good pitch-black, high contrast colortheme for nvim, *please* let me know.
